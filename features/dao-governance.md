# â­• DAO Governance

## DAO Governance

_The concept of DAO governance in cryptocurrencies refers to a decentralized decision-making system in which platform users have a voice in the decisions made. This is possible through the allocation of voting power to token holders on the platform. In this way, users can propose, vote on, and decide on important platform issues such as changes in transaction fees, security upgrades, and the addition of new tokens._

#### DAO Governance in CEX AI

_In CEX AI, the application of the DAO governance concept will be done through the creation of a decentralized governance system for CEX-AI token holders. This would allow token holders to participate in important decision-making related to the platform, such as adding new cryptocurrencies and changing transaction fees. Additionally, token holders could propose new features and improvements to the platform and vote on important decisions._

_Implementing DAO governance in CEX AI would allow the user community to have a more active role in the evolution and development of the platform, which could lead to greater transparency and user trust. Furthermore, a decentralized governance system could help keep the platform updated and competitive in an ever-evolving market._
