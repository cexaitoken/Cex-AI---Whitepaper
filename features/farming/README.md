# â­• Farming

## Farming

_The concept of "farming" in cryptocurrencies is a type of investment strategy that involves allocating cryptocurrencies to a "staking" or "liquidity mining" platform to earn rewards in the form of new coins or tokens. In other words, users provide liquidity to a cryptocurrency protocol and, in exchange, receive rewards in the form of more cryptocurrencies._

_In CEX AI, the farming concept will be applied in several ways. One way is through staking or liquidity incentive programs, where users can deposit their cryptocurrencies into a wallet designated by CEX AI and earn rewards for doing so._

#### _Farming in CEX AI_

_In CEX AI, the farming concept is through liquidity pools. Our users will be able to deposit two different cryptocurrencies into a liquidity pool on CEX AI and receive rewards in the form of a new token that represents their participation in the pool. This new token can be traded on CEX AI, which allows users to profit from the token's increased value._
