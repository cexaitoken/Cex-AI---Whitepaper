# â­• Staking

## Staking

_The concept of "staking" in cryptocurrencies is a way for users to participate in a cryptocurrency network by locking a certain number of coins in a wallet or platform to help secure the network and, in return, receive rewards in the form of new coins or transaction fees._

_In CEX AI, the concept is through staking incentive programs, where users can lock their cryptocurrencies in a wallet designated by CEX AI and earn rewards for doing so._

#### Staking in CEX AI

_For example, CEX AI creates an incentive program for users who lock a certain amount of a specific cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, or the CEX-AI token, in a staking wallet. In exchange, users can receive rewards in the form of another cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or the CEX-AI token, which can be traded on the CEX AI platform._
