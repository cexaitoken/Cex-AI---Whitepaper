# â­• Pools Staking

#### Pools Staking

_Cryptocurrency staking pools are groups of investors who come together to combine their resources and increase their chances of earning rewards through the staking process._

_When CEX-AI is staked, it will be held in a specific wallet to help validate transactions on the network and maintain the security of the blockchain. In return, our staking users may receive rewards in the form of CEX-AI._

_Our staking pools allow investors to combine their CEX AI holdings to increase their chances of being selected to validate transactions on the network and earn rewards._

_Through the pools, we will offer other advantages, such as reducing the risk of reward variations, providing technical support, simplifying the staking process, and providing a community of like-minded investors._
