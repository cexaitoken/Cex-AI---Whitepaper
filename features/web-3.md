# â­• Web 3

## Web 3

_The concept of "Web 3" refers to a new generation of internet technologies and protocols that aims to create a more decentralized, secure, and transparent internet using blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies._

_At CEX AI, the application of Web 3 concepts is achieved through the integration of blockchain technology into its platform. This allows CEX AI to create a decentralized and secure infrastructure for its users, making the platform more transparent and trustworthy._

#### Web 3 in CEX AI

_Additionally, CEX AI uses smart contract technology to automate processes and create a more efficient and reliable platform. For example, CEX AI can create smart contracts for cryptocurrency trading, which are automatically executed when agreed-upon conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries._

_Another application of Web 3 at CEX AI is the offering of decentralized cryptocurrency custody services. This means that the platform does not hold custody of its users' cryptocurrencies, but rather allows users to manage their own private keys through decentralized wallets._

_Furthermore, CEX AI may explore the possibility of creating a decentralized trading platform where users trade directly with each other, without the need for intermediaries. This could reduce transaction costs and improve the efficiency of the trading process._

the application of Web 3 concepts at CEX AI allows the platform to create a more decentralized, secure, and efficient infrastructure for its users, offering a more transparent, trustworthy, and flexible trading experience.
