# â­• Pools Yield Farming

#### Pools Yield Farming

_Yield farming "pools" of cryptocurrencies are groups of investors who join together to combine their resources and increase their chances of earning rewards through the farming process._

_CEX AI's Yield farming is a process where our investors provide liquidity to a pool of cryptocurrencies in exchange for rewards. These rewards can be paid in the form of CEX AI._

_By pooling their stakes in a Yield farming pool, CEX AI investors can share risks and rewards more efficiently, rather than performing the process alone. In addition, CEX AI's Yield farming pools offer more attractive reward rates and soon will provide technical support and a community of investors with similar interests._

Yield farming pools can be an interesting option for our investors who want to maximize their returns in cryptocurrencies._
