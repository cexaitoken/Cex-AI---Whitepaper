# ⭕ Create a Wallet

_In order to commence trading on CEX AI, it is a prerequisite to possess a wallet and connect it to our platform. In the event that you do not already possess one, it is incumbent upon you to configure a wallet that supports the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. Wallets for both computers and smartphones are readily available, so it is advisable to select the one that is most suitable for your specific needs._

_When setting up a wallet, it is crucial to diligently follow the setup guide to ensure that it is configured accurately. Furthermore, it is essential to download the latest version from an official source to prevent any potential discrepancies._&#x20;
