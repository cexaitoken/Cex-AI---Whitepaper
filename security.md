_ICO projects that have a KYC (Know Your Customer) process and auditing procedures in place provide investors with an additional layer of protection and credibility. KYC procedures help to prevent fraudulent activities, such as money laundering, while auditing ensures transparency and accuracy of the project's financial records. The implementation of these procedures is essential for establishing trust and credibility with investors, minimizing risks, and protecting the investments of legitimate investors._
